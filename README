Ghost Chaos Web
Version 1.3-Pre
http://webgames.freeze-dev.com/ghostchaos


The player finds himself in the role of a paranormal activist who is sent to a
spooky house to find all ghosts that are living there.
Tap (and drag) the screen or use your mouse to move the light cone of your flashlight around to
turn ghosts visible. Either tap or click on the ghosts to make them disappear immediately
or follow their route until they dissolve completely.
Use both ways how you see appropriate: Tapping on a ghost restores the opacity
of every other ghost on the screen while following ghosts with your light cone
allows you to target multiple ghosts at once.

This game offers three different difficulty settings and an unlimited amount of
levels. Ghost Chaos starts off with just two ghosts to catch but with each new
level a new ghost will be added to the game.
